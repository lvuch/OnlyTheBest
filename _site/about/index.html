<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>Only the Best Bridal Couture provides custom bridal couture of the highest quality to your specifications and measurements. Each dress is a one-of-a-kind design where the bride can incorporate her ideas and wishes towards the wedding gown of her dreams. Each dress is created individually - using expert construction and finishing techniques. A series of fittings commence and continue until all details of the look and fit have reached perfection. Upon completion, the dream dress is expertly delivered to the bride. A benefit of Only the Best Bridal Couture custom services is that each bride and dress is given the individual care and attention the fulfillment of a personal dream deserves. Only the Best gives each bride the option of determining how far in advance she wants her dress delivered.</p>

<h2>The Designer</h2>
<p>Alisa Tyler is the owner and designer of Only the Best Bridal Couture. Her initial interest in sewing was sparked from her maternal grandmother’s love of sewing. Learning to sew at the age of 8, this talent remained untapped as a child, except for occasionally making puppets and doll clothes.</p>

<p>Upon leaving for college, Alisa took her sewing machine along and began to sew sporadically in her free time. This ignited an interest in sewing that was deeper than ever before. She began to make dresses for herself as well as friends and family, perfecting her skills while developing her passion. Since the early 1980’s sewing has remained one of her best developed talents.<blockquote class="pull-quote">She has refined her skills by studying couture sewing under Susan Khalje and pattern draping under Julien Cristofoli, and spent hours learning from successful businessmen and women in the industry.</blockquote></p>

<p>Always interested in fashion, her interests have mostly drawn her to create formal attire – prom, evening and wedding gowns, specializing exclusively in wedding gowns for most of her career. She has refined her skills by studying couture sewing under Susan Khalje and pattern draping under Julien Cristofoli, and spent hours learning from successful businessmen and women in the industry. Sterling Capricio of Los Angeles is the person who inspired her to turn her love for sewing into a career.</p>

<p>Relocating to Arizona in 2004, Alisa decided to study the southwest wedding culture and develop relationships before starting her business here. She began Only the Best Bridal Couture in April 2009, premiering her first collection at the Phoenix Bridal Debut in January 2010 - where she was featured as the only local designer participating in the fashion show. Her dresses were chosen for the Grand Finale of the fashion show during the June 2010 Phoenix Bridal Debut.</p>

<p>Sewing has remained Alisa’s passion for almost 30 years and she is happy to provide her skills and expertise in creating your special gown for your special day.</p>
