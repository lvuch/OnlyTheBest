  I had Alisa alter my ‘off the rack’ wedding gown which was already 4 sizes too large for me. I was hesitant about whether or not this could be done, but not only did she make it happen - she was awesome to work with! She made it really easy for me - arranging fittings around my busy schedule. She did a fantastic job and the dress fit as if it was custom made!

  Alisa made the very beautiful dress worn by my wife on our wedding day! Her work is absolutely amazing; her ability to work with the brides she serves is extraordinary. I was moved to tears to see how beautiful my wife my wife looked on her very gorgeous gown. Extremely highly recommended.

  27 years ago I found the most talented designer. With a vision of what I wanted my special dress to look like, Ailsa designed and delivered so much more. From the ring bearer tuxedos that she made to the bridesmaids and maid of honor dresses, to the fit of my wedding dress, she made the experience fun, stress free (believe it or not) and visually stunning. I recommend Alisa without reservation.

  I was constantly being told that the dress I wanted didn’t come in my size, or there was not enough time to order it for my wedding. I was running out of time and almost in tears when I met Alisa. She asked me to describe my dream dress while she sketched out my vision. I was excited - she made my dress exactly as I described it. I was so pleased, I invited her to the wedding and sent my coordinator to bring her back to take a picture with me before the wedding started! Thanks Alisa!

    Alisa was kind and patient with my wedding dress requests. She communicated really well with me about what made the most sense for my budget and style choice. She took my sometimes unclear ideas and turned them into the wedding dress I had in mind! My wedding dress was a beautiful reflection of me and my tastes. There is nothing that fits better than a custom-made, tailored gown! I would use Alisa again for another formal gown and I have recommended her to friends who have also used her dressmaking services. Wonderful dressmaker!
